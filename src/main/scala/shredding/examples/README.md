### Example Queries

Each query directory contains a set of input relations in various formats with their respective types, 
as well as flat and nested queries that use these relations. 

* `simple`: simple example queries, including queries from the notes 
* `normalize`: queries that will trigger normalization rules
* `tpch`: TPCH queries from Slender paper. Since TPCH loads data from a CSV file, there are TPCH loader specifics in this directory.
