### Example Queries

Each query directory contains a set of input relations in various formats with their respective types (`Relations.scala`, 
as well as flat (`FlatTests.scala`) and nested queries (`NestedTests.scala`) that use these relations. 

* `simple`: simple example queries, including queries from the notes 
* `normalize`: queries that will trigger normalization rules
